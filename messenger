Message after messenger installation :
   
 What's next? 
              

  * You're ready to use the Messenger component. You can define your own message buses
    or start using the default one right now by injecting the message_bus service
    or type-hinting Symfony\Component\Messenger\MessageBusInterface in your code.

  * To send messages to a transport and handle them asynchronously:

    1. Uncomment the MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN env var in .env
       and framework.messenger.transports.async in config/packages/messenger.yaml;
    2. Route your message classes to the async transport in config/packages/messenger.yaml.

  * Read the documentation at https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html
